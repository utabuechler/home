I am currently a doctoral researcher at the Computer Vision group of the Heidelberg Collaboratory of Image Processing (HCI).
Prior to that, I obtained a Masters degree in Scientific Computing at the University of Heidelberg. My main research interests are
Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Beyond that, I gained additional skills in applied mathematics 
(Optimization, Statistics etc.) due to my mathematics-based degree courses. For further information about my Career and skills
