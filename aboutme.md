I am currently a doctoral researcher at the Computer Vision group of the <a href="https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">Heidelberg Collaboratory of Image Processing (HCI)</a>.
Prior to that, I obtained a Masters degree in Scientific Computing at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. My main research interests are Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Beyond that, I gained additional skills in applied mathematics  (Optimization, Statistics etc.) due to my mathematics-based degree courses. For further information about my Career and skills see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/career">here</a>.

During my free time I like doing sports (especially playing volleyball and swimming), spending time with my family and friends and traveling around the world. I additionally try to regularly acquire new/improve my skills in not work-related topics like languages or music/instruments.
